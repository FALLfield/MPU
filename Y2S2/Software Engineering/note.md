## Chapter 1 Software Engineering process

- Some questions

  - What is software
    - Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be
      developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general
      market
  - What are the attributes of good software
    - Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to
      the

- Software products

  - Generic products
    - Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to and customer who wishes
      to buy them
    - Example: PC software
  - Customized products
    - Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own
      needs
    - Example: Embedded control systems

- Product specification

  - Generic product specification
  - Customized product specification

- Essential attributes of good software

  - Maintainability
  - Dependability and security
  - Efficiency
  - Acceptability

- Application types

  - Stand-alone applications
  - Interactive transaction-based applications
  - Embedded control systems
  - Entertainment systems
  - Systems of systems

- Internet software engineering

  - The Web is now a platform for running application
  - Organizations are increasingly developing web-based systems rather than
    local systems.
  - Users do not buy software buy pay according to use.

- Web based software engineering

  - Incremental and agile development
  - Service-oriented systems
  - Rich interfaces

- User design

  - User experience
    - User Interface

- Software process activities

  - Market researching
  - Software specification
  - Software development
  - Software validation
  - Software evolution

- Software engineering ethics
  - Software engineering involves wider responsibilities than simply the
    application of technical skills
