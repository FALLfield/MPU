## Chapter 1 Software Engineering process

- Some questions

  - What is software
    - Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be
      developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general
      market
  - What are the attributes of good software
    - Good software should deliver the required functionality and good
      performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable
  - What is software engineering
    - Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with
      all aspects of software production
  - What ae the fundamental software engineering activities
    - Software specification, software development, software validation and
      software evolution
  - What is the difference between software engineering and computer science
    - Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software engineering
      is concerned with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful
      software
  - What is the difference between software engineering and system engineering
    - System engineering is concerned with all aspects off computer-based
      systems development including hardware, software and process engineering.
      Software engineering is part of this more general process

- Software products

  - Generic products
    - Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to and customer who wishes
      to buy them
    - Example: PC software
  - Customized products
    - Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own
      needs
    - Example: Embedded control systems

- Product specification

  - Generic product specification
  - Customized product specification

- Essential attributes of good software

  - Maintainability
  - Dependability and security
  - Efficiency
  - Acceptability

- Application types

  - Stand-alone applications
  - Interactive transaction-based applications
  - Embedded control systems
  - Entertainment systems
  - Systems of systems

- Internet software engineering

  - The Web is now a platform for running application
  - Organizations are increasingly developing web-based systems rather than
    local systems.
  - Users do not buy software buy pay according to use.

- Web based software engineering

  - Incremental and agile development
  - Service-oriented systems
  - Rich interfaces

- User design

  - User experience
    - User Interface

- Software process activities

  - Market researching
  - Software specification
  - Software development
  - Software validation
  - Software evolution

- Software engineering ethics

  - Software engineering involves wider responsibilities than simply the
    application of technical skills

- Waterfall model phases

  - Requirements analysis and definition
  - System and software design
  - Implementation and unit testing
  - Integration and system testing
  - Operation maintenance

- Agile Methods

  - The aim of agile methods is to reduce overheads in the software process and
    to be albe to respond quickly to changing requirements withoout excessive
    rework

- Process Improvement
  - Purpose (DCQ)
    - Enhancing the quality of softwares
    - REducing costs
    - Accelerating their development process
  - Approaches to improvement
    - The process maturity approach, which focuses on improving process and
      project management and introducing good software engineering practice
    - The agile approach, which focuses on iterative development and the
      reduction of overheads in the software process
  - Process metrics
    - Time taken for process activities to be completed
    - Resource required for processes or activities
    - Number of occurences of a particular event
  - Capability maturity levels
    - Level1 initial
    - Level2 Managed
    - Level3 Defined
    - Level4 Quantitatively managed
    - Level5 Optimizing

## Chapter3 Requirement Engineering

    - Description
      `
      Market     Requirement -> Design    ->     Validation   -> Evaluation
                           Implementation   Test
                                            Verification

- Requirement Engineering

  - The process of establishing the services that a customer requires
  - What is requirement?
    - It may rango from a high-level abstract statement of a service or of a
      system constraint to a detailed functional specification
    -

- Functional & Non-Functional Req.

  -
  - Goals and requirements
    - Goal - A general intention of the use such as ease of use
    - Verifiable non-functional reuirement -- A statement using some measure
      that can objectively tested
  - Usability requirements
    - Easy use system for medical staffs
      - Four hours training is enough
  - Metrics
    - Speed
    - Size
    - Easy to use

- Requirements engineering processes

  - Depending on the application domain, the people involved and the
    orgnaization developing the requirements
  - ## Steps
    -
    -
    -
  -

- Requirements elicitation
  - The requirements elicitation and analysis process
    - Requirement discovery
    - Requirement classification and organization
    - Requirements prioritization negotiation
    - Requirements specification
