Hello everyone, My name is Harry and my group members are Ethan and Wandelin. This is our software engineering project which is called schedule management system.
This video is about how to use this system and future plan. This system is useful to students, teachers and everyone who may need a event schedule management application.

First I would like to talk about the account application. In our system, each user has their own database and account. So we click login and signup to create a new account called test_user, and its password. When we finish signup, the browser will jump to the login page. We enter our account and password and then, the main page is opened. This is our main page, its a calender and we can add daily events in this page.

Then we change to another user which has some preentered information.

Ok, I would like to introduce this page from 3 views. Day Month and Week. We can change the 3 views using buttons on the right hand. In every views, we can see the events stick on the cubes seperated by dates and if we change to smaller view we can see more details of the event and duration and description... On the left hand, we have switch buttons to help us see past dates and future plans. Today button leads to the today calender page.

Adding events is the main function of our system. You can add events through two ways. Click the add button or click the date. We have 3 priorities and each of them will display a different color on the calender page. we can see it later. We can also edit the event by clicking the events on calender, like this, or delete them by your will.

Then another function related to event is the notice. THere is a button and when we click it, it will display the approaching events in 5 days.

Then is note application. It's just like a note book to record something, like your favorite cities and today's weather. It has pagination function to avoid messy records.
